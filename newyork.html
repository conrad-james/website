                    <p><strong>Concept</strong><br><br>Demographic trends show people getting married and starting families later in life than previous generations, if at all. As property prices escalate this growing single population have little alternatives to make shift home shares or small, often lonely living conditions. With the exception of traditional family life, the house is limited in it's ability to accommodate shared life, whereas apartment blocks often seem to isolate their inhabitants. Instead of compacting the traditional house and apartment topologies into smaller and smaller units, we propose a new housing topology, based on shared living, which is achieved by creating a clear distinction between residential private spaces and the recreational shared spaces.<br><br>Apartment blocks bring people into close physical proximity with minimal social proximity. This building type, in the transition from private to public space provides very little, if any, communal space.<br><br></p>

                    <p><strong>Sustainability</strong><br><br>By setting out an environmental agenda at the outset of the project, substantial energy savings are more likely to be made in the long run. Sustainable material would be given preference, timber would be Forest Stewardship Council certified, and locally sourced to reduce transport energy. High-durability, low-maintenance, low-VOC materials, paints and adhesives are to be employed. Three garbage chutes aid recycling. Use is made of natural ventilation and solar energy for heating in the winter months. The concrete slab construction has good acoustic insulation properties and a high thermal mass, and so acts to moderate internal temperatures. Insulation is to a high standard and Windows are double glazed (argon-insulated, low emissivity).<br><br>The building design lends itself to efficient passive heating and cooling of the building.

These include a heat recovery mechanical ventilation system and underfloor heating and cooling, solar water heaters and a standing column well. This is the most substantial piece of environmental infrastructure in the building, but produces hot water at very high efficiency in the winter for both the mechanical ventilation system and underfloor heating, and virtually free cooling in the summer. We chose not to include photovoltaics due to the high costs, but would put in place the basic infrastructure so that such panels could easily be installed in the future.</span><br><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;"><br></span><br><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;"><br></span><br>Design partner: Koniak design<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;"><br></span>Sustainability Consultant: Arup Associates</p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 lead"><p>Compact Community</p><p><br></p><p>This project was a competition entry to investigate new housing typologies for a site in New York, and a way of examining how community can be enhanced by architecture. The proposal is a compact, energy efficient, high specification new building type for the 21st century, which aims to enable informal community life to re-emerge within the city.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Concept</p><p><br></p><p>Demographic trends show people getting married and starting families later in life than previous generations, if at all. As property prices escalate this growing single population have little alternatives to make shift home shares or small, often lonely living conditions. With the exception of traditional family life, the house is limited in it's ability to accommodate shared life, whereas apartment blocks often seem to isolate their inhabitants. Instead of compacting the traditional house and apartment topologies into smaller and smaller units, we propose a new housing topology, based on shared living, which is achieved by creating a clear distinction between residential private spaces and the recreational shared spaces.</p><p><br></p><p>The building is envisioned predominantly for single professionals and key workers. As such its primary use is not intended for families, but does not preclude them, and it is anticipated it would attract a wide spectrum of individuals. We have strived for simplicity of form to keep construction costs down. Savings are spent on a better specification and a good environmental infrastructure.</p><p><br></p><p>Each resident would have his/her own small private ‘unit’ of kitchen, shower-room/WC and bedroom, and access to larger shared areas – principally lounges and sun-terraces. A typical floor may consist of six units sharing two lounges and terraces (plus laundry facilities and garbage chutes). In addition there is a large ‘garden lounge’ on the ground floor for use of all residents, opening out to the shared garden.</p><p><br></p><p>DIAGRAM 2. The units are positioned to the north overlooking the street; these bright spaces are highly insulated both thermally and acoustically. The shared areas, of terraces and lounges, overlook a communal garden and face south to benefit from the sun. In the centre is the circulation zone, which has views south through the terraces.</p><p><br></p><p>The distinction between the private and the shared zones allows for various managemental scenarios with a varying degree of resident's involvement.</p><p><br></p><p>Building Description</p><p><br></p><p>The building mass is tall and slender, just within the vertical zoning envelope. This maximizes natural light and ventilation, and gives a generous garden space. The street elevation is stepped back in line with the neighboring brownstones, with hard landscaping at street level. The facade is contextual consisting of a masonry wall with large openings expressing the double-level units behind, and a recessed main entrance.</p><p><br></p><p>The units are each 400-sq. ft., the minimum allowed under current zoning regulations. With efficient planning, and the living room omitted, this makes for a high standard of accommodation for a single person or couple.</p><p><br></p><p>The masonry facade relates to the heavy block construction of the units, as they are to be heavily insulated both thermally and acoustically. In contrast to this, the back of the building consists of extensive glazing and timber louvers relating to the southerly aspect, and the staggered arrangement of terraces and lounges, beyond which the main staircase is visible, giving the elevation a dynamic, open quality.</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 lead"><p>.</p><p><br></p><p>The lounges and terraces vary in size and position, they are not given specific roles but the intention is that the residents will use these areas in unpredictable ways, depending on the social dynamics, the size of the particular room etc. They are designed as bright, high, spacious, open spaces. The terraces have a secondary role in winter, when they can be converted into conservatories. Glass screens, adjacent to the front glazing of the lounge, are top-hung and can slide to close the terrace.</p><p><br></p><p>DIAG 3 Section: Private and communal arrangement The arrangement of double units and extra high lounges create a split section of four groups. The first/second floor units (1-5) would share the second floor common areas; the third/fourth floor units (6-11) would share the raised third floor common areas; The fifth/sixth floor units (12-17) would share the fifth floor common areas; and the top three units (18-21) have their own common area.</p><p><br></p><p>In the garden, paths weave around a tapestry of allotments like a maze and connect various activities: A hot-tub, an outdoor shower, a BBQ area, a lawn, terraced areas and shaded areas. The residents can either use the allotments, stepped at differing levels, or let grow wild. They provide an evolving framework for the garden and allow a healthy degree of disorder.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>
